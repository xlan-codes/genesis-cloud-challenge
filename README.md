# Genesis Cloud Challenge
Hi there! You just found our challenge repository that contains the description of various problems that have come up while working at Genesis Cloud.

You're most likely already participating in our recruiting process, but if you stumbled here by chance and would like to work with us, please do check out our [open positions](https://www.genesiscloud.com/about#open-positions).

If you're in the process, then by now we have got a better appreciation of who you are and now we would like to get a feel for the way you work. To do this, we would like to challenge you to collaborate with us on solving a problem that we've encountered before.

Please understand that this is not a test or an exam, there are no right and wrong answers. This is just an opportunity for us to collaborate together and solve an interesting problem. You also can get an understanding of the type of things we have to do in Genesis Cloud, being a startup and all.

What we expect to learn about you from this is:
* Your working style
* How you think and solve problems
* How you communicate

And what we expect you'll learn about us is:
* How we work as a team
* The types of problems we deal with

## Next Steps
1. Read the [list](problems/) and choose a problem to solve.
1. You'll be given a link to a private repository that you can clone and work on to submit your challenge.
1. Open an Issue in your new repo with the problem you've chosen. You can use this issue to discuss the problem at hand or for asking questions.
1. Solve the problem any way you like, but do your best to follow best-practices and consistent, organized code. We wonâ€™t impose any programming language restrictions but at this point, the review process will be easier for us if you stick with the Javascript stack and ReactJS as the frontend framework.
1. You should be doing the development of this in a topic branch. Once you have something in your branch, you can open a Pull Request (to your own master branch) any time you like. You can use this pull request to discuss something code-specific, or if you'd like some feedback on your code.
1. Once you have something more substantial to show, make sure you have a pull request open so that a code review can be performed within it.
1. Have fun!
