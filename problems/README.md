# Problems

If you haven't yet read the top-level [README][1], please do so now before reading the rest of this page.

So basically what you need to do now is pick a problem to solve.

And remember, while solving a problem please communicate and share what you're thinking, even if you think it's something not important or you're creating too much "noise." Rather err on the side of being "verbose" than going into pure stealth mode.

### Things we value
- The thought process you used to structure the solution, why it was done this way rather than that way
- Clean code, we want you to show us the best code you can do within the time you have (but please don't comment every single line of code, because then it'll just be noisy code :))
- Good documentation with the steps to run your project
