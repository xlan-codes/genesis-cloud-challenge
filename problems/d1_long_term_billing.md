# Long-term Billing

Genesis Cloud currently offers an on-demand pricing model solution for our customers already with a valid payment method added to their account, on which the resources/services are billed at the end of each month based on hourly usage. We want to offer a more long-term billing solution for our customers that want to take advantage of our services for an extended period (one-month minimum). This allows making the price fixed per month for each instance and in turn, we offer a lower price for the customerâ€™s long commitment and we can charge the customer on instance creation as we know in front how much we can charge.

Create a [Genesis Cloud account](https://gnsiscld.co/mokvno) then create an on-demand instance of any type (using account Credits). You will notice that we show "hourly costs" as the selected billing option is "on-demand".

You are tasked with introducing a new flow where we offer the "Monthly" billing option, on which, the customer pays ahead (before they see the instance in "creating"). The dashboard should show the monthly price and let the customer know they will be paying upfront for the full month using the payment method already added via the account dashboard. Have in mind that often payments fail due to credit card issues or additional steps like 3D Secure validation.

For this challenge, feel free to change anything in the dashboard layout that you think would improve the UX and make things better for the user.

Note: To create an instance, a valid payment method is required. When you sign up your account will receive some free credits if you want to start an instance however, instance creation is not required for this challenge

Here are the [Genesis Cloud Style Guidelines](./) and the [Figma assets](https://github.com/genesiscloud-challenges/challenges/raw/main/problems/assets/GC-Style-Guide.fig). Please use these to complete the challenge.

Final note: If there's anything you don't understand or is ambiguous, open an issue in your repository with the question ;)
